Description: Google Client e.g. to access Google Calendar
 Google offers a number of services using a Google account. Many of these
 services also expose a Web API. this package provides a set of Emacs
 modules for accessing these services from inside Emacs. These modules are
 designed with an Emacs-centric, rather than a Web-browser centered view of
 the world. Where necessary Emacs package browse-url.el is used to invoke the
 Web browser of choice.
